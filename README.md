# About Catellite

Catellite is about orbits and gravitational pull. The objective of the game is to launch cats in rockets from Earth into orbit. The cats will be launched from Florida, and the engine will provide the force needed to launch and will stay attached the entire time. There will be side rockets to provide the cats with enough tangential velocity to be in orbit. The cats must orbit the Earth a ceratin number of times without crashing into the Earth for the player to win. If the cats go out of the screen or crash, the player will lose and have to restart.

# Instructions

The player can select the initial launch velocity and launch the rocket with a button once they choose a starting velocity. After the launch, the player can press any key to start the side rockets and the cat-rocket will have tangential velocity. The player has to hope that the rocket won't crash into the Earth, and once it orbits Earth a certain number of times, the player will win and can gamble their chances and play again.
